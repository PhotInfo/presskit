#PhotInfo 6.00

##Press Kit

PhotInfo is an app to control all the information (location, date, camera, focal length, etc.) contained in your photos.

##Why PhotInfo

Digital cameras (including those in mobile devices) add some metadata to the photos they take. These data are called Exif tags. They provide an opportunity to learn not only the exact date and time of the shoot, but also parameters such as exposure time, shutter speed, image resolution, device model, ISO, focal length, whether the flash was used, etc.

With PhotInfo you can access the images in your iPhone or iPad and view all of their metadata, delete these metadata or modify some of them.

You may delete/modify the image tags to protect your privacy before sharing the image; you may add GPS data if you have forgotten to turn on location services when you took the picture; you may joke by setting improbable location values; you mayâ€¦

An user wrote me that she use the app in a photography course she teaches in California; another user from Russia, wrote that he use the app to understand which setting make some pictures better than others and improve his photography technique.
