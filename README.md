# PhotInfo 6.10 ~ Press Kit

PhotInfo is an app to control all the information (location, date, camera, focal length, etc.) contained in your photos.

## Why PhotInfo

Digital cameras (including those in mobile devices) add some metadata to the photos they take. These data are called Exif tags. They provide an opportunity to learn not only the exact date and time of the shoot, but also parameters such as exposure time, shutter speed, image resolution, device model, ISO, focal length, whether the flash was used, etc.

With PhotInfo you can access the images in your iPhone or iPad and view all of their metadata, delete these metadata or modify some of them.

You may delete/modify the image tags to protect your privacy before sharing the image; you may add GPS data if you have forgotten to turn on location services when you took the picture; you may joke by setting improbable location values; you mayâ€¦

A user wrote me that she uses the app in a photography course she teaches in California; another user from Russia, wrote about using the app to figure out which settings make some pictures better than others and to improve his photography technique.

## 6.10: On the Mac

With version 6.10, PhotInfo arrives on the Mac. The UI is tweaked for the Mac, but he app works like on iPhone/iPad: it only accesses the pictures in your Photos Library (the ones you see in the native Photos app). PhotInfo for Mac shows all the tags contained in these images and let you modifying the main tags.

If you buy PhotInfo on one platform you can download the app on the other platforms for free.

## 6.00: A complete rewrite

After about 7 years on the store, PhotInfo needed a complete rewrite to keep up with the continuous evolutions of iOS, so the app has been rewritten from Objective C to Swift.

Between PhotInfo 5.00 and 6.00 I wrote PhotInfo NG from scratch, catching up with the PhotInfo's features. Reached the feature parity, PhotInfo switched to the NG code.

## Features

With PhotInfo you can:

* display an image with the main tags in a single view
* view all the Exif tags from the picture
* copy the key data or the content of individual tags
* create a copy of the image eliminating or modifying tags for:
	* the place (you can take it from another picture)
	* the date and time when the photo was taken (you can take it from another picture)
	* the orientation
	* the author (the artist)
	* the copyright
	* the image description
* create a copy of the image with the minimum content of the tags (related to image data structure, such as the image size, resolution and orientation)
* see where the photo was taken, in different ways:
	* visualize the city name
	* locate in a map
	* find the coordinates
	* show the address
* share, favorite, hide or delete a photo
* quickly scroll through the albums of your iOS device
* support for burst photos
* view the tags directly from other apps with the PhotInfo's **Extension**

PhotInfo app is in **costant development**, so new features will be added soon. Download now and stay tuned!

## Uniqueness

What makes this app unique are:

 * the clean and simple UI
 * the completeness of tags shown
 * the possibility to see the tags in raw format or in a more human readable one
